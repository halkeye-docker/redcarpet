# Redcarpet

Source: https://gitlab.com/fengshaun/redcarpet

Would not recommend using, looks like some sort of POC project.

* Creates thumbnails every time without any caching
* Only supports one level of subdirectories
* Urls are client side only (as in no url updates)

Docker image works, Set to debug mode so it doesn't use fcgi
